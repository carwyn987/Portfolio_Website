# Portfolio_Website
This is my portfolio website source code. 
All of this is self-built, and should be a good representation of the quality of my code.

I decided to build this application with React using the NPM/NodeJS platform.
My choice to do so was due to the repetitive nature of certain frontend elements such as infoboxes,
project pages, etc.

Current plan for the project pages are to save the information in json objects, and read them in to
auto generate the pages. This should be the easiest way to add and update webpages.

Began working on this project on 11/11/21.
Progress can be seen through commits.
