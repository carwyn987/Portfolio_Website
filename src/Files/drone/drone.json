    "desc": "To fulfill the Senior Honors Research Project I & II required for graduation with a B.S. Honors in Computer Science, I have embarked on a project involving drone collision avoidance. Beginning in 2D, the final goal is to have a physical drone dodging incoming projectiles. This will journey from in-browser reinforcement learning to Unreal Engine simulation, and finally to hardware, computer vision, and environment sensing and interpolation.",
